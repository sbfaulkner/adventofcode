# Advent of Code Solutions

## Day 1: Not Quite Lisp

A bit awkward, but it works.

## Day 2: I Was Told There Would Be No Math

Better than Day 1, but nothing special.

## Day 3: Perfectly Spherical Houses in a Vacuum

`Route#deliver` could use some refactoring, but generally a decent solution.

## Day 4: The Ideal Stocking Stuffer

Quite happy with how succinct the approach used here is, although performance might be a bit lacking.

## Day 5: Doesn't He Have Intern-Elves For This?

The two independent versions muddy this solution somewhat, but I think this is reasonable.

## Day 6: Probably a Fire Hazard

The parsing/processing is pretty ugly... can definitely be cleaned up.

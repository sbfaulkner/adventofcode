# Advent of Code Solutions

## Day 1: Not Quite Lisp

A bit awkward, but it works.

## Day 2: I Was Told There Would Be No Math

Better than Day 1, but nothing special.

## Day 3: Perfectly Spherical Houses in a Vacuum

`Route#deliver` could use some refactoring, but generally a decent solution.

## Day 4: The Ideal Stocking Stuffer

Quite happy with how succinct the approach used here is, although performance might be a bit lacking.
